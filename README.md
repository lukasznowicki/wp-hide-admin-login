# Hide Admin Login

This small plugin can prevent exposure of admin login. You knon, that you should change admin login. Using "admin" or something like that for admin user isn't very clever thing to do. So, you should use something like "eZf8rfeRxkv". Like password, yes. But there is very easy method to expose your login anyway. Just use http://your-site.com/?author=1 - this should redirect to http://your-site.com/author/yourlogin and that's it. With this plugin, this thing is impossible.
